# Brownie_FUNDME
Smart Contract example for beginners.
This is a simple smart contract project that is made using solidity and python.
In this project we take an Aggregatorv3Interface contract from chainlink docs and use it to find the eth to usd pricefeed.
Basically, we create a fundable contract that can be funded by people.
We deploy it to different networks.
